I just completed my Master's at the MIT [Center for Constructive Communication](https://www.ccc.mit.edu/) at the [Media Lab](https://www.media.mit.edu) supervised by [Deb Roy](https://www.media.mit.edu/people/dkroy/overview/). I did my Bachelor's in Honours Math and Computer Science at McGill University in Montreal, Canada and did research with [Siva Reddy](https://sivareddy.in/) at [Mila Quebec](https://mila.quebec/en).

I'm passionate about equitable, pluralistic, safe AI for the benefit of all. My research interests include evaluation of LLMs for fairness and safety, pluralistic alignment, and developing equitable human-centered AI. 

In my Master's thesis, I developed an LLM-powered framework for analyzing how ideas evolve into policy recommendations in deliberative assemblies and how dialogue shapes the collective stance and voting behavior. I identified key drivers behind shifts in delegate support and introduced methods to reconstruct opinion change dynamics directly from transcripts using LLMs. In doing so, I demonstrated how LLMs can surface deliberative mechanisms that are often hidden from view, pointing toward tools that enhance transparency and fairness in real-world decision-making.


My background is in mathematics, computer science, and natural language processing (NLP) with a focus on addressing harmful biases in language models. I also have experience in vision-and-language models such as Stable Diffusion. Beyond my academic pursuits, I am enthusiastic about linguistics, playing ultimate frisbee, and [nurturing a growing collection of house plants](https://elinorp-d.github.io/blog/).
