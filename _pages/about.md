I'm currently a predoctoral researcher working with [Michiel Bakker](https://miba.dev/) at [MIT](https://web.mit.edu). 
I completed my Master's at the MIT [Center for Constructive Communication](https://www.ccc.mit.edu/) at the [Media Lab](https://www.media.mit.edu) supervised by [Deb Roy](https://www.media.mit.edu/people/dkroy/overview/). I did my Bachelor's in Honours Math and Computer Science at [McGill University](https://www.mcgill.ca/) in Montreal, Canada and did research with [Siva Reddy](https://sivareddy.in/) at [Mila - Quebec AI Institute](https://mila.quebec/en).

I'm passionate about equitable, pluralistic, safe AI for the benefit of all. My research interests include fairness & societal impacts of LLMs, pluralistic alignment, and developing equitable human-centered AI. 


My background is in mathematics, computer science, and natural language processing (NLP) with a focus on addressing harmful biases in language models. I also have experience in vision-and-language models such as Stable Diffusion. Beyond my academic pursuits, I am enthusiastic about linguistics, playing ultimate frisbee, and [nurturing a growing collection of house plants](https://elinorp-d.github.io/blog/).

Feel free to reach out if you'd like to chat about any of the above!
