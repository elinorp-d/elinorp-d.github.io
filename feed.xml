Along the way, I’ve developed a taste for different flavours of plant-parenting styles and preferences for different species.

Our house growing up was always full of plants, though I didn’t really appreciate it consciously until later. My most salient plant memories are gardening with my dad every year, from arduous weeding and futile watering of our perpetually brown backyard grass, to buying seeds, flowers, and plant starters from Home Depot<d-footnote>tomatoes, peppers, cucumbers, eggplants, swiss chard, butter lettuce, oodles of green beans, and more!</d-footnote> and planting them together in the garden. I would also play outside as a kid and make “mud salads” with a mixture of wild spring onions, chopped up leaves, and mud. I can’t really explain that one. I could go on about this and maybe I’ll write a dedicated post on plant memories another time.</p> <h2 id="in-the-beginning">In the beginning</h2> <h3 id="there-was-a-succulent">…there was a succulent</h3> <p>My collection<d-footnote>Obsession?</d-footnote> began with my first plant: a zebra succulent named Watson Moses in 2019.</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/plants/watson_moses_2019-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/plants/watson_moses_2019-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/plants/watson_moses_2019-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/plants/watson_moses_2019.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> I was so excited that I did an entire photoshoot with Watson the minute I brought him home! </div> <p>I also got a snake plant right before I left for university.</p> <h3 id="then-a-pineapple">then, a pineapple</h3> <p>I moved to Montreal for university<d-footnote>McGill!</d-footnote> and needed to feel a semblance of homeyness in my new dorm, so I immediately capitalized on my new independence to purchase several plants, including a golden pothos, a curly spider plant, a small bird of paradise, and a <em>pineapple plant</em>!<d-footnote>Purchased from [Leaves Cafe](https://maps.app.goo.gl/EiwxsHBTZrxBJo8T7)</d-footnote> This was very exciting and brought me lots of joy and attention for growing a tiny little pineapple from my dorm room.</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/plants/pineapple_dorm_2019-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/plants/pineapple_dorm_2019-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/plants/pineapple_dorm_2019-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/plants/pineapple_dorm_2019.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1 fourhundred" width="100%" height="auto" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/plants/pineapple_2019-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/plants/pineapple_2019-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/plants/pineapple_2019-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/plants/pineapple_2019.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1 fourhundred" width="100%" height="auto" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> I eventually harvested and ate the pineapple on my birthday.

For me, this was a time in which mine <em>intensified</em>, in part due to the fact that I was home and could propagate all of my dad’s plants! Another factor was the pandemic forced a lot of us to spend more time online, and my Instagram feed became more and more plant-oriented. I learned a ton about different species, care, pests, and validated my desire to expand my collection. The third factor was that caring for live plants gave me a sense of grounding, purpose, and joy while while the world outside felt so bleak and uncertain.</p> <h3 id="propagation-exponentiation">propagation exponentiation</h3> <p>Putting my newly learned skills to the test, I took cuttings of my dad’s arrow plant and pothos plants.
