## Summer 2021

### disaster strikes
In the summer of 2021 I was away doing an internship and upon my return, I discovered an insane [thrips](https://www.houseplantjournal.com/thrips/) infestation that wrecked havoc over much of my plant collection. At the time, I had no idea what plant pests were and this was a relatively unfortunate introduction and I did not do a great job at dealing with it.<d-footnote>I didn't do much, and that was my biggest mistake. Never again!</d-footnote>

## Fall 2021

Due to the pests, many of my plants weren't thriving and I didn't take a lot of photos. Here are two that I will highlight:

### star wars pothos

Remember Star Wars Pothos that I'd propagated on May 4th, 2020? I used command strips to pin the vines on the wall above my desk in Sept 2021, and by December it was absolutely thriving!<d-footnote>Aroids love to climb, so this shouldn't be surprising</d-footnote>

    </div>
</div>

### hoya compacta

I wanted my hoya compacta to live, but this lil guy had other plans. In October 2021, I propagated in an attempt to try and save it.

            In October 2021, I chopped and propagated this hoya. The little jar on the left never grew anything and eventually died about a year later.

        </div>
    </div>
</div>

I don't have any more photos between the end of March 2022 and April 2023, but it seems to me that this plant stopped growing. In general they grow very slowly, but I think it might've had flat mites that I couldn't see due to the dense curvature of the leaves. When I moved out in April 2023, it had fewer leaves in April 2023 than it did in 2022 (last photo above). My roommate took this plant with her so I don't know how long it lived after that.
