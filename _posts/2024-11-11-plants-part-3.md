### survived the winter
Thankfully everything survived over the winter holidays. The many areas of my apartment filled with plants was combatting the isolation and sadness that was pretty overwhelming during the continued lockdown in the cold, dark January and February.

### Hoya discovery

I bought a gorgeous Hoya Publicalyx from Facebook marketplace and I instantly fell in love. While I cannot find the original photos of this beautiful plant, Shortly after I bought her, I did a little photoshoot. I did meticulously document all her tendrils, baby leaves, and crazy growth patterns and I decided that I needed _more hoyas_!
