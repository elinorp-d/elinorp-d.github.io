## Montreal

It's September 2020 and I've just moved into an apartment in Montreal during the pandemic, what's the first thing my roommate and I do? Order in poutine and eat it on our dining table thats covered in... (you guessed it!) plants!

It seems the current plant inventory was:
* 2 pothos (original and Star Wars)
* 1 snake plant
* 1 curly spider plant
* 1 air plant
* 1 zebra succulent (Watson Moses)
* 1 arrow plant
* 1 bird of paradise
* 1 rubber plant (ficus tineke)
* 1 mother of thousands succulent
* philodendron propagations
* a couple others my roommate brought from home

### surviving the winter
For some reason, I did not take many photos<d-footnote>This is absurd to me right now because my camera roll is _full_ of plants usually.</d-footnote> but we acquired a ton of plants over the next couple months. For example, it took _8 minutes of video_ for me to document the plant watering for my friend to take care of them over Christmas/New Year's. I moved all of them to the center of the living room and my bedroom and grouped by levels/types of care. I took some screenshots of the videos and counted at least 50 plants!
