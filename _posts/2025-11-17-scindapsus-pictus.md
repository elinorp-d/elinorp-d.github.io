I sublet my first apartment during the summer of 2020, but that didn't stop me from scrolling on Facebook Marketplace looking for plants. On June 7, 2020 I messaged a person selling a [scindapsus pictus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scindapsus_pictus), otherwise known as a satin pothos. Since I was out of town, I coordinated for a friend of mine to pick it up for me on June 15. He took care of it until I finally moved into the apartment in late August, 2020.
The plant was a bit scraggly after being in my subletter's care for two months, so I propagated it when I finally moved in in Sept 2020. Somehow I never took a photo until January 2021, where the propagated vines have rooted and begun growing!

I chopped and propped again in April to try my luck growing in leca instead of soil. One year later, it was thriving!

The mother plant was also doing well. By the time I moved out of the apartment in April 2023, it was huge!

The summer of 2023 I was traveling and my dad took care of my plants. Then, I moved to Cambridge, Massachusetts to begin grad school at MIT in September 2023. Somehow, I never took any good photos of this plant until the following spring/summer of 2024.

Unfortunately, the mother plant wasn't looking great due to underwatering while I was traveling, so I propagated it _again_ and by August, it was a very happy beautiful plant which I then sold to my friend and I'm told it's doing really well still!

I essentially did a switch of the plant in leca into soil, and I chopped the plant formerly in soil and propagated it in leca again. It's been doing well, and every so often I give it a hair cut since I like it to be bushy and not too leggy.
